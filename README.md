# MatID
A modo kit for quickly applying materials for baking ID maps

## Installation
This is a modo kit so install it like normal. I've only tested this on Modo 10, but I don't think it's doing anything
fancy. Let me know if you run into any issues and if it works on other versions of modo!
* Extract/Clone into `%appdata%/Luxology/Kits`
* Restart modo

## How to use
* Click the `MatID` button to open the swatch panel
* `Click` a swatch on the panel to apply it to the selected polygons.


## Uninstallation process
* Delete `csprance_matid` from `%appdata%/Luxology/Kits`
